        "description": "# SymbolTable Implementation with Scope Management"
""
"## 🎯 Objective"
"Implement a comprehensive `SymbolTable` class for FeLangCore's semantic analysis module to manage symbols and scopes during compilation."
""
"## ✅ Current Status: **COMPLETED**"
""
"The `SymbolTable` has been **fully implemented** at `Sources/FeLangCore/Semantic/SymbolTable.swift` with all required features:"
""
"### 🏗️ Core Features Implemented"
"- ✅ **Thread-safe symbol management** with NSLock"
"- ✅ **Hierarchical scope system** (global, function, procedure, block, loop)"
"- ✅ **Symbol tracking** with usage/initialization state"
"- ✅ **Built-in function support** (I/O, conversion, math functions)"
"- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with Result types"
"- ✅ **Debug support** with detailed state inspection"
""
"### 🔧 Technical Implementation"
"```swift"
"public final class SymbolTable: @unchecked Sendable {"
"    // Symbol representation with metadata"
"    public struct Symbol { name, type, kind, position, isInitialized, isUsed }"
"    "
"    // Scope management"
"    public func pushScope(kind: ScopeKind) -> String"
"    public func popScope() -> String?"
"    "
"    // Symbol operations  "
"    public func declare(...) -> Result<Void, SemanticError>"
"    public func lookup(_ name: String) -> Symbol?"
"    public func markAsUsed/markAsInitialized(...) -> Result<Void, SemanticError>"
"}"
"```"
""
"### 🔗 Integration Status"
"- ✅ **SemanticAnalyzer.swift**: 1000+ lines using SymbolTable extensively"
"- ✅ **SemanticError.swift**: Comprehensive error types with position tracking  "
"- ✅ **FeType system**: Rich type system with compatibility checking"
""
"## 📋 Acceptance Criteria ✅"
"- [x] Symbol declaration and lookup across scope hierarchy"
"- [x] Proper scope push/pop with automatic ID generation"
"- [x] Thread-safe concurrent access support"
"- [x] Built-in function pre-population in global scope"
"- [x] Usage and initialization tracking for warnings"
"- [x] Integration with semantic analyzer and error reporting"
""
"## 🚧 Resolution"
"This issue should be **closed as completed** since all requirements have been fulfilled. The SymbolTable implementation is production-ready and fully integrated into the semantic analysis pipeline."
