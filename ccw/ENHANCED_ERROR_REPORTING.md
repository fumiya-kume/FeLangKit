# Enhanced CCW Claude Code Error Reporting

CCW now provides comprehensive error reporting when Claude Code execution fails, giving users detailed information to troubleshoot issues.

## Error Reporting Features

### 1. Detailed Error Information
When Claude Code execution fails, CCW now displays:
- **Clear error message**: "❌ Claude Code execution failed with error: [details]"
- **Error output**: Complete stderr content from Claude Code
- **Exit code**: The specific exit code returned by Claude Code
- **Troubleshooting suggestions**: Context-aware guidance based on the error type

### 2. Context-Aware Troubleshooting

CCW analyzes the error and provides specific suggestions:

#### Installation Issues
```
Error: executable file not found in $PATH
Suggestions:
- Claude Code CLI is not installed or not in PATH
- Install from: https://claude.ai/code
```

#### Permission Issues
```
Error: permission denied
Suggestions:
- Check file permissions for Claude Code executable
- Try: chmod +x $(which claude)
```

#### Authentication Issues
```
Error: authentication failed
Suggestions:
- Claude Code authentication may have expired
- Try: claude auth login
```

#### Network Issues
```
Error: network timeout
Suggestions:
- Network connectivity issues
- Check internet connection and proxy settings
```

### 3. Workflow Integration

- **Proper failure handling**: The workflow now properly fails when Claude Code execution fails, instead of continuing with validation
- **Progress tracking**: Step 4/9 is marked as "failed" instead of incorrectly showing "completed"
- **Error logging**: Detailed error information is logged for debugging
- **User feedback**: Clear visual indicators and actionable guidance

### 4. Error Output Example

When Claude Code fails, users will see output like:
```
🤖 Starting Claude Code in interactive mode...
📋 Issue context has been saved to: .claude-initial-prompt.md
💡 Please read the file and implement the requested changes.
✅ When done, exit Claude Code to continue with validation.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Claude Code execution failed with error: exit status 1
Error output:
Error: Authentication token has expired
Please run 'claude auth login' to reauthenticate

Exit code: 1

🔍 Troubleshooting suggestions:
- Claude Code authentication may have expired
- Try: claude auth login
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster debugging**: Users can immediately see what went wrong
2. **Actionable guidance**: Specific steps to resolve common issues
3. **Better workflow reliability**: Proper failure handling prevents false positives
4. **Improved user experience**: Clear error communication reduces confusion

## Technical Implementation

- **stderr capture**: Uses `io.MultiWriter` to capture error output while preserving interactive mode
- **Error analysis**: Parses error messages to provide context-specific suggestions
- **Exit code reporting**: Extracts and displays process exit codes for debugging
- **Workflow integration**: Proper error propagation through the CCW workflow

This enhancement ensures that when Claude Code execution fails, users have all the information they need to understand and resolve the issue quickly.
