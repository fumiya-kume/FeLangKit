I need to implement the following GitHub issue:

**Issue #62: Create `SymbolTable` with scope management**

# SymbolTable Implementation with Scope Management

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a comprehensive `SymbolTable` class for FeLangCore's semantic analysis module to manage symbols and scopes during compilation.

## ✅ Current Status: **COMPLETED**

The `SymbolTable` has been **fully implemented** at `Sources/FeLangCore/Semantic/SymbolTable.swift` with all required features:

### 🏗️ Core Features Implemented
- ✅ **Thread-safe symbol management** with NSLock
- ✅ **Hierarchical scope system** (global, function, procedure, block, loop)
- ✅ **Symbol tracking** with usage/initialization state
- ✅ **Built-in function support** (I/O, conversion, math functions)
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with Result types
- ✅ **Debug support** with detailed state inspection

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
```swift
public final class SymbolTable: @unchecked Sendable {
    // Symbol representation with metadata
    public struct Symbol { name, type, kind, position, isInitialized, isUsed }
    
    // Scope management
    public func pushScope(kind: ScopeKind) -> String
    public func popScope() -> String?
    
    // Symbol operations  
    public func declare(...) -> Result<Void, SemanticError>
    public func lookup(_ name: String) -> Symbol?
    public func markAsUsed/markAsInitialized(...) -> Result<Void, SemanticError>
}
```

### 🔗 Integration Status
- ✅ **SemanticAnalyzer.swift**: 1000+ lines using SymbolTable extensively
- ✅ **SemanticError.swift**: Comprehensive error types with position tracking  
- ✅ **FeType system**: Rich type system with compatibility checking

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria ✅
- [x] Symbol declaration and lookup across scope hierarchy
- [x] Proper scope push/pop with automatic ID generation
- [x] Thread-safe concurrent access support
- [x] Built-in function pre-population in global scope
- [x] Usage and initialization tracking for warnings
- [x] Integration with semantic analyzer and error reporting

## 🚧 Resolution
This issue should be **closed as completed** since all requirements have been fulfilled. The SymbolTable implementation is production-ready and fully integrated into the semantic analysis pipeline.
