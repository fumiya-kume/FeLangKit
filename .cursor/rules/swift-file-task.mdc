# Swift File Task Validation

## Quality Gates
Execute these commands before any commit:
```bash
swiftlint lint --fix && swiftlint lint
swift build && swift test
```

## Pre-commit Checklist
- [ ] SwiftLint passes without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass including golden file tests
- [ ] Build succeeds on target platform (macOS 13+)
- [ ] No force casts (`as!`) or force unwrapping in new code
- [ ] Public APIs have documentation comments
- [ ] Changes maintain module boundaries per [Package.swift](mdc:Package.swift)

## Performance Validation
For parser changes, also verify:
```bash
# Run performance tests if available
swift test --filter PerformanceTests

# Check memory usage with instruments for large inputs
# Verify parsing limits are respected
```

## Documentation Updates
When modifying public APIs:
- Update module documentation in `Sources/{Module}/docs/`
- Add usage examples to doc comments
- Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) if architecture changes
