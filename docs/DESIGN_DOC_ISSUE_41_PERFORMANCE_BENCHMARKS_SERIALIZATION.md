## 1. Problem Statement

### Background
Following the comprehensive Codable implementation review (Issue #40), there is a critical need to establish robust performance benchmarks for serialization/deserialization operations in FeLangKit. While the existing codebase includes some performance testing infrastructure in `PerformanceBenchmarkTests.swift`, there is no standardized, comprehensive benchmarking suite that can:

- Provide consistent performance baselines across different data sizes and complexity levels
- Detect performance regressions during development
- Identify optimization opportunities in custom Codable implementations
- Compare performance between different serialization strategies (AnyCodable vs Native)
- Measure memory usage patterns during large-scale operations

### Core Issues
1. **Performance Visibility Gap**: Current performance testing lacks comprehensive metrics and standardized reporting
2. **Regression Detection**: No automated system to detect performance degradation in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Optimization Guidance**: Insufficient data to guide performance optimization decisions
4. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Limited visibility into memory consumption patterns during serialization
5. **Scalability Assessment**: Unclear performance characteristics with large datasets

### Success Criteria
- Establish baseline performance metrics for all serialization operations
- Implement automated performance regression detection
- Identify and document optimization opportunities
- Create comprehensive benchmarking suite for continuous monitoring

## 2. Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- **Primary**: Create comprehensive performance benchmarking suite for all serialization/deserialization operations
- **Secondary**: Establish performance baselines and regression detection mechanisms
- **Tertiary**: Identify and document optimization opportunities in current implementations
- **Operational**: Integrate performance monitoring into CI/CD pipeline
- **Documentation**: Create performance best practices guide for developers

### Non-Goals
- Implementing performance optimizations (separate effort after benchmarking)

   - End-to-end serialization time
   - Memory allocation latency

3. **Resource Usage Metrics**

#### Performance Thresholds
```swift
struct PerformanceThresholds {
    // Regression detection thresholds

    static let errorThreshold: Double = 1.25      // 25% degradation
    static let criticalThreshold: Double = 1.50   // 50% degradation
    
    // Absolute performance targets
    static let singleOperationMax: TimeInterval = 0.001  // 1ms max
    static let batchOperationMax: TimeInterval = 1.0     // 1s for 1000 items
